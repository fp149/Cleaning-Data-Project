# Cleaning-Data-Project
final project for coursera data science specialization course 3

This Repo contains 3 components

1. run_analysis.r file
  This file contains the logic for reading in the raw data and outputting the required tidy data set

2. tidy_averaged_data.txt
  A copy of the output produced by run_analysis.R
 
3. UCI HAR Dataset
  This folder contains the files extracted from the .zip provided as the raw data for this project


Individual steps used in the process of converting raw data -> processed tidy data are documented within comments in the run_analysis.R file

Note: for the run_analysis.R file to run without adjustment, the zip file containing the raw data, or the extracted data as provided in this repository must be stored in c:/Coursera/DataScience/c3Final


The choice of a wide tidy data format was made for this particular application
